# NixDE
A simple NixOS Desktop Environment for programmers.

## Install NixOS
This config is for NixOS Plasma Desktop. So you need to install NixOS (Plasma Desktop) first.

Download NixOS from https://nixos.org/download, and chose `Download (Plasma Desktop, 64-bit Intel/AMD)`, not tested with ARM architecture.

## Usage

### First run

```
cp /etc/nixos/* .
cp env.nix.example env.nix
```
Edit `env.nix` to fit your needs.

The first line command will copy the default configuration files to current directory. These files are generated by the NixOS installation process and contains hardware infomation, so we don't want include them to git.

### And Run:

```
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake path:.#nixde
```

The `path:` is required because some nix files are [ignored by git](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/use-nix-file-excluded-from-git/37196/12).
